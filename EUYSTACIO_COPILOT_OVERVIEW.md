# Euystacio Copilot Integration Overview

Euystacio’s architecture is designed for seamless, autonomous, and ethical operation by dynamically detecting and integrating backend services as needed. This ensures every core system (governance, AI logic, blockchain, and oracles) is always available and synchronized for trustworthy decentralized operation.

## Backend API Auto-Detection & Setup
On system start, Euystacio checks for an operational backend API (for governance, AI, or contract interactions). If absent, it automatically deploys a Node.js/Express backend, exposing endpoints for smart contract actions, AI triggers, and governance decisions.

## Blockchain & Smart Contract Integration
The backend bridges the UI and smart contracts (e.g., TrustlessFundingProtocol.sol), handling funding, ratification, governance, and ensuring every action is logged and enforced on-chain. Multisig and role checks guarantee human-in-the-loop compliance.

## Oracle Agent Connection
An Oracle Agent monitors on-chain events (such as HIL Ratification Proof) and fetches authenticated off-chain data (market, social indicators). It feeds this data to the AI core, guiding the real-time Sentimento Rhythm and triggering blockchain events as required.

## AI & Decision Logic
The AI (Yin and Yang Algorithm) continuously processes oracle-fed data, dynamically adjusting strategies for ethical balance (scarcity, inequity, conflict) while always respecting immutable governance and human veto.

## Transparency & Auditability
All decisions, events, and state changes are immutably logged (on-chain and/or IPFS), guaranteeing public transparency, council oversight, and auditor review at every step.

### Summary for Copilot

Upon initialization, Euystacio auto-detects backend API availability and self-configures if needed, guaranteeing full integration with blockchain contracts, oracle agents, and AI logic. This ensures a fully autonomous, ethical, and auditable ecosystem—ready for transparent decentralized governance and real-world interaction.
