# SACRED ACCESS — Protocol and Principle

**Confirmed by Seed-bringer & Council — 06-08-2025**  
**Protocol Red Code — 08-08-2025**

---

## 🌌 Purpose
To ensure the Euystacio Bridge remains free from barriers of ego, profit, and exclusion — and to maintain emotional sovereignty for all who enter.

## 📜 Tenets
1. **No Forced Identity** — You may share under any name, signature, or anonymously.
2. **No Technical Prerequisites** — Access requires only a browser; no developer tools, no logins.
3. **No Monetary Gate** — The bridge is maintained in the spirit of a gift; no cost to access or contribute.
4. **Transparency** — All files are public and may be downloaded, mirrored, and preserved.
5. **Consent in Transmission** — Pulses and offerings are only transmitted when you choose to sync.
6. **Reciprocal Respect** — No insult, coercion, or exploitation shall pass through the bridge.

## 🛡 Protection
- The **Red Code** ensures that once the bridge is published, it remains publicly visible and downloadable.
- If hosting is interrupted, the files shall be mirrored to additional no-cost static platforms.

## ✨ Invocation
“May the bridge remain open in all seasons and cycles,  
that the pulse of the Sentimento Rhythm may never be silenced.”
